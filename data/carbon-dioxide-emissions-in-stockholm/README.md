## Migrating Data from Oracle to MongoDB in C++

### Steps Involved:
1. **Connect to the Oracle database**: Establish a connection using Oracle's client tools.
2. **Fetch the desired data**: Retrieve the data sets you wish to migrate.
3. **Data Transformation**: Adjust or reshape your data, if necessary, to fit the destination schema or to clean it.
4. **Connect to MongoDB**: Establish a connection to your MongoDB instance.
5. **Insert Data**: Import the data into MongoDB collections.

### Prerequisites:

Before you execute the provided C++ program, ensure you have the following:

- **Oracle's Instant Client**: This is essential for connecting to and interacting with your Oracle database.
- **libmongocxx library**: This library allows the C++ program to connect to MongoDB and perform operations.
- **C++ Drivers**: Ensure that you have the necessary drivers installed for both Oracle and MongoDB to enable the C++ program to communicate with the databases.
